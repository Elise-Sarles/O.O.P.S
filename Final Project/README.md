# StocK Market Game

## Synopsis
This is a text game that simulates a simple version of the stock market. It ask you to login or create an account then you can play. 
It is fun and rather simple game play.

## Motivation
For class we had to biuld a code and I wanted to do somethinging fun and challenging to make.  It was un and I plan to come back and update it once I learn more about code/java and do so. 

## How to Run
Everything it need to run is in the folder. There a few pieces of code that will need to be changes based on the comuputer

## Code Example
This is an example of the code you with need to change. Change the file path for every time you see this. Go to the file in the scr folder name userinfo.txt and find out it's new path to put there. 
```
File fx = new File("/Users/student/eclipse-workspace/Stockmarket project/src/userinfo.txt");
Scanner scan = new Scanner(fx);
```
You will also have to do this for the Stocks txt page. 
```
File f = new File("/Users/student/eclipse-workspace/Stockmarket project/src/Stocks.txt");
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(f);
```

## Tests
There is a test java called SMCheck.java it is a JUnit4.
